Edit config/mom.yml. This are the parameters of the server you want to
connect to. In the subscriber part you need to provide your IP in order
to recive updates from the server.

 xmlblaster:
   mom:
     host:                82.103.128.69  # production IP
     port:                8080           # production port
     publish_user:                       # put your user here
     publish_password:                   # put your password here
   subscriber:
     host:                               # your local listening IP
     port:                8081           # your local listening port
     public_host:                        # your public IP (if you use NAT)
     public_port                         # your public port (if you use NAT)
     topics:              IMS, SSO       # the topics you want to subscribe to
     subscriber_user:                    # put your user here
